If makefile does not work please let me know and guide me through.
SelectionSort runs though

To use the program you must give N which is the lenght of the array
    -meaning that list how many elements(numbers) you are wanting to sort

Next text will print out asking you to input numbers so that the program can do selection sort
-here the numbers in the array will go through the four loops and selection sort functions
    until all numbers have been sorted

 The numbers you have randomly put will be now sorted and printed onto the screen.
